Description:

(1)Top10.ipynb. We used the basic pandas.DataFrame operations to obtain top 10 incident types in zip 10023 with each of their total numbers, and then created a pandas.Series to show the result.

(2)Parking.ipynb. We used the basic pandas.DataFrame operations to calculate the fraction of no. of illegal parking incidents in zip 10023 against total no. of incidents in zip 10023, and the fraction of no. of illegal parking in all zips against total no. of incidents, and then made a comparison.
